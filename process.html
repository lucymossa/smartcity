        <br><h2>Requirements</h2><br>
        <p>Requirements were extracted from the user story and then rated by business and user priority, technical difficulty, and resource availability. 
            Listing and refining requirements is useful to develop a content audit and site map. It is also important to divide requirements into 
            business, user, and (non-) functional to make sure all parties involved are represented and a balance is reached. For example, a 
            system that implements only business requirements will not be useful to the user or might even be lacking in functionality.</p><br>

        <h2>Content Strategy</h2><br>
        <p>A qualitative audit was developed for the content strategy. Its advantage over quantitative audits lies in 
            its more detailed specification of content. In general, content audits are very useful to plan and manage the 
            content of a web service and are an effective tool of getting a structured, detailed overview. The total number 
            of pages was limited to eight to create a usable, easy-to-navigate service that would not overwhelm the 
            elderly users. Any desired features can be added later, when users are familiar with the basic system.</p><br>

        <h2>Site Map</h2><br>
        <p>The site map shows the page interconnectivity and navigation. It was important to not use a sign in function, 
            so the user will be able to access the application effortlessly. Similarly, the task flow diagram demonstrates 
            different user goals and how they can be accomplished. Both the site map and task flow are very effective tools 
            for getting a deeper understanding of a service’s navigation and are useful to show how a user might 
            perform a common task.</p><br>

        <p>Active Path 6-Up was then used to refine one of the previously proposed solutions. 
            In contrast to Crazy 8, the goal of this exercise was to create six versions of the same idea and not six 
            different solutions. In order to determine which of the initial eight sketches to further refine, the primary 
            persona was roleplayed to interact with all eight screens. The purpose of these methods is to think creatively 
            and to enhance the design process by relying on instinct and experience. Both are very effective in developing 
            multiple design solutions.</p><br>

        <h2>semantics differential scale</h2><br>
        <p>Following the ideation, a semantics differential scale was applied to judge the six drafts’ age-friendliness. 
            None of the six screens was significantly better or worse compared to the other screens. Therefore, the elements 
            of the screens which resulted in high ratings, e.g., using icons instead of text, were combined for the final design. 
            Next, this was evaluated against design patterns and principles. As design patterns are solutions to common problems, 
            they were effective to evaluate and improve the design and expected behaviour. Both are annotated on the wireframe page of this portfolio.</p><br>
