            <h2>01 Philips SmartSleep</h2><br><br>
            <p>I developed this app as an extension of Philips' SmartSleep collection. Unlike their other apps, which have very specific
                    uses like measuring sleep apnea, this application is meant to reach a broader range of customers. Philips SmartSleep helps
                    the user to fall asleep and through the rewards system, conditions them to improve their sleep quality in the long term.
                    Motivation is created by earning points, which can be exchanged against a wide range of products, all of which can be paired
                    with the app such as the Philips Somneo light or even a mattress that slowly rocks the user to sleep. Points are earned 
                    every night by sleeping and extra boosts are given out for reaching milestones, like fulfilling a personal sleep goal!

            <h2>02 The Ways in the Willows</h2><br><br>
            <p>The Ways in the Willows is an interactive, online story map based on the story of 'The Wind in the Willows',
                 written by Kenneth Grahame in 1908. The experience allows the user to be introduced to the story by familiarising
                  themselves with the spatial setting. A hidden quiz tests the user's knowledge of the book and shows a reward for
                   successful completion. Scroll down the page to see the images or click on the link for the full experience.

            <h2>03 BCI Headphones</h2><br><br>
            <p>Proposed service that allows the user to listen to music on their phone and control it by thought, 
                all thatâ€™s needed are the silicone ear piece or the headphones. Electrodes in the devices record 
                the userâ€™s brain activity and send it to their phone via Bluetooth, which translates it into a 
                device command. Playing songs, creating playlists and searching for new music has never been 
                this easy! Scroll down to see the key components or click on the link below to find out more 
                about the science and the branding.

            <h2>04 Feelies by IMDb [in progress]</h2><br><br>
            <p>While the name is vaguely based on the famous 4D cinema experience described by Aldous Huxley in his novel 'Brave New World', 
                the actual application offers users a film matching their mood. It is created using an IMDb api and facial recognition analysis. 
                Detailed research has helped to match moods with different genres, for example a comedy 
                is very obviously a funny film whereas horror films are generally perceived as scary. Altogether, the userâ€™s face can 
                be categorised into one of six moods: happy, sad, neutral, frightened, surprised or angry. Scroll down 
                to have a look at the UI design, the link to download the app is coming soon. (To be available on Android only, sorry iPhone users!)

            <h2>05 Grannyphone [in progress]</h2><br><br>
            <p>A smart city service which seeks to prevent the feeling of loneliness in London's elder community: 
                A smart phone box allows elders to call nearby civilians and meet them for a 'good strong cuppa' tea. 
                The sustainable phone box has free WiFi access, is automated and incorporates solar panels for green energy. 
                The project investigates how IoT technology can help cities to connect from more than a technological point of view. 
                More information coming soon!
